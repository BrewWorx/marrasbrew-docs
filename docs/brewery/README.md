# Origin of everything

We're a group of homebrewers who in the fall of 2018 decided to join forces and rent out a place dedicated for brewing beer. We started off as small existing groups of people with the total headcount of 9 brewers. Since then some have come and gone and we're now at ten.

Our brewhouse is a unit in a larger complex of similar units of varying sizes.

Some of the key features of the unit are:

- Floor area of **35m²** (377 ft²) with a loft space of **18m²** (194 ft²)
- Ceiling height of about **5m** (16.5 ft)
- Water inlets with a **60 liter** (16 gal) water heater
- Water proof epoxy coated floor and walls with a drain
- Toilet facilities
- Power outlets for 230V and 400V @ 50hz
- Ventilated with an adjustable roof fan
- Camera surveillance
